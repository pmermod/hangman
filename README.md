# Welcome to Hangman

Guess the secret word, one letter at a time, or you will hang. What fun!

## How to Start and End the Game

To start the game type `node .`  
To end the game enter `ctrl + c`

## How to Play

You will be shown a series of blanks that represent the letters in the word.
Guess a letter you think is in the word and enter it at the prompt.

If you guess a letter that is in the word, it will replace the blank(s) for that letter.
To win the game guess all the letters in the word before making six wrong guesses.

If you guess a letter that is not in the word you will begin to hang.
For each wrong guess another line in the hangman figure will be drawn until the full hangman figure is drawn by the sixth wrong guess, which ends the game and you lose.
